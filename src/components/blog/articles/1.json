So the best thing to do is leave and look for someone to replace me if possible. Though I'm level 18 VIP 0 player, I make around 30,000 to 40,000 trophies in weekend festivals and same amount or less in weekday festivals. I'll be glad if I can get someone with similar capabilities to replace me. Thank you."
